            Achiements is a new beta feature on Sanara<br/>
            This feature being new, don't hesitate to come tell your feedbacks on Sanara's official server<br/>
            Move achievements will be added if people are liking this new system.<br/><br/>
            You can earn them by filling some conditions, they are then displayed on your profile (you can see it by doing the profile show command)<br/>
            To enable this new feature you must generate your profile at least once<br/>
            All achievements have 3 levels, becoming harder every time you reach one<br/>
            If you win an achievement, Sanara will react with one of these emotes (depending of what level you reached): ðŸ¥‰ðŸ¥ˆðŸ¥‡<br/>
